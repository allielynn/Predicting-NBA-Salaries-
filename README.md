Predicting NBA Salaries with Linear Regression

Description: As part of a linear regression course at UCLA, I collaborated with a team of peers to conduct an in-depth analysis of NBA player salaries, aiming to identify significant predictors influencing salary variations. Employing linear modeling techniques in R, we examined potential predictors, assessing their statistical significance. A crucial component of our analysis involved verifying the assumptions of linear regression (constant variance, linearity, and normality) by evaluating the diagnostic plots. To better satisfy these assumptions, we applied a transformation to the y-variable, improving the model assumptions. After addressing outliers and ensuring the model met regression assumptions, we selected the optimal model based on AIC, AICc, and BIC, effectively managing multicollinearity. Our model provided valuable insights into the factors influencing NBA player salaries, allowing us to explore salary fluctuations and the nuances of significant predictor variables. By incorporating research on the basketball industry, we were able to interpret our findings more effectively, offering a comprehensive, data-driven perspective on the determinants of NBA player salaries.
